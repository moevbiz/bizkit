# Bizkit: a Kirby starter-kit

Template repository for [Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) websites. Featuring opinionated configuration, some plugin dependencies, and a setup script for quick installation. Built to use with run-of-the-mill shared hosting providers.

> ### Disclaimer
> Feel free to use this as a template or inspiration for your own projects. This boilerplate is intended for my personal use and¬†I won't take responsibility if something doesn't work as intended üç™

### Features

#### Main features
- **`setup` script** to get started from the CLI without much configuration
- **`/public/` directory** intended to work as the root directory on any live server, while the entire kit can remain under version control
- deployment with rploy

#### Development tools
- [Laravel Mix](https://laravel-mix.com) with BrowserSync enabled and configured
- [rploy](https://github.com/jongacnik/rploy) and Kirby-specific configuration for rapid deployment
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com) preinstalled
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) preinstalled
- [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev) preinstalled

#### Kirby Plugins
- [Cachebuster](https://github.com/schnti/kirby3-cachebuster)
- [Kirby Ray](https://github.com/genxbe/kirby3-ray)

#### Opinionated files and small conveniences
- `site/snippets/global/header.php`: contains opening html and body tags and links to default assets, and an Emoji favicon
- `site/snippets/global/footer.php`: contains closing html and body tags
- `site/config/config.php`: automatically enables debug mode if an admin user is logged in
- `site/config/routes.php`: if a `prelaunch` option is set, the site will be hidden for the public and all requests are redirected to the login screen
- `site/plugins/.gitignore`: allows prefixing custom plugins with "`my-`" to automatically be included in the git repo


### Requirements
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [Laravel Valet](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet) or [Valet Linux](https://cpriego.github.io/valet-linux/)

### Installation
1. [Create a new repository from this template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template)
2. Donwload or clone your repository and navigate to the directory
3. run `bash setup`

The walkthrough script will (1) install all dependencies, (2) `valet link` the site if it's not already in a parked directory, (3) prompt for the title of the site and an email/password combination to install the panel, (4) create a `.env` file in the `public` directory and create a local config file with appropriate settings. It is of course possible to do all this manually.

### Usage
```npm run dev``` to start local dev server with hot reload. 

`npm run deploy` to bundle assets and deploy to server using [rploy](https://github.com/jongacnik/rploy). 

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The template also contains **sensitive PHP scripts**, such as `authenticate.php` which authenticates as almighty. It is not recommended to sync anything but the `public` directory to a production environment.

`npm run push` to lazily push everything to remote repository (consider writing meaningful commit messages instead).
