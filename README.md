# üç™ moevbiz' Kirby CMS boilerplate

### Requirements
- Composer (https://getcomposer.org/), 
- NPM (https://www.npmjs.com/), 
- Laravel Valet (https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/valet (MACOS) | https://cpriego.github.io/valet-linux/ (LINUX))

### Installation
Run `bash setup` ‚Äì¬†The walkthrough script will install all dependencies and `valet link` the site, 
if it's not already in a parked directory. It will prompt for the title of the site
and email/password to install the panel. Finally it will create a `.env` file
in the `public` directory.

### Info
The production ready Kirby app lives in the `public` directory.

Bizkit is basically a Kirby Plainkit, but includes a very minimal preconfigured file setup and some required plugins.

#### Files
- `site/snippets/header.php`: contains opening html and body tags and links to default assets
- `site/snippets/footer.php`: contains closing html and body tags
- `site/config/config.php`: automatically enables debug mode if an admin user is logged in
- `site/plugins/.gitignore`: allows prefixing custom plugins with (`mb-`) to automatically be included in the git repo
- `site/plugins/mb-panel/index.js`: a panel login screen showing the page title

#### Plugins
- `k3-panel-view-extended`
- `kirby3-dotenv`
- `kirby3-janitor`
- `pagetable`

### Disclaimer
Not really intended for public use. I'll continue upgrading this template repo as I see fit.
